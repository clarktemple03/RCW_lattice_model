# RCW lattice model

A simple python script to explore the model as described in https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c03584


## To use
- entropy_enthalpy_calc.py to see species contributions
- parameter_sensitivity.py to see effects of parameter values 
- Runs model for a single parameter space point and plots free energy versus collapse degree
- Various points in parameter space can be run by modifying parameter_setting class
- Happy to take comments, question, or additional considerations (No promises on speedy replies)
