# RCW lattice model

A simple python script to explore the model as described in XXX


## To use
- Download rcw.py and simply run 
- Runs model for a single parameter space point and plots free energy versus collapse degree
- Various points in parameter space can be run by modifying parameter_setting class
- Happy to take comments, question, or additional considerations (but may take some time to respond)
